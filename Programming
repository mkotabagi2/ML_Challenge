%%Flight arrival Data Taken from https://transtats.bts.gov 
%%in the problem we are designing a binary classifier.
%%The steps in the binary classifier includes dividing the data into training data and testing data 
%%using the trining data we collect and assemble Nxd matrix of features vectors into matrix. 
%%Assemble targets into T, a column vector of size Nx1 containing class-labels -1 or 1.
%%Construct the augmented feature vector set xa by perpending a column of 1s in front  of the 
%%matrix X.Find the linear classifier W=pseudoinverse(xa)*T. Here pseudoinverse is the standard in
%%linear algebra software. the classifier W is a column vector .


%ONTIME2 was in csv mode. i saved it in xls format  and considered only
%%Load the data in excel format
%%num contains the numerical data from the data. txt contains the text data from the data.
[num,txt,raw]=xlsread("ONTIME2.xls",1);

%%delete the header from the txt data
txt(1,:)=[];

%%unique numeric value for each flight carrier. as the unique carrier is
%%found by considering 3 columns and they also contain string
%%the columns Unique_Carrier, Airline_id, Carrier together make the Airline carrier unique
%%to maintain a uniqe number, Incremented a value 'count' such that a unique combination gets a unique number.

%%forming X and T matrix
%%X matrix is the matrix that contains the required data, on which we design a linear classifier or binary classifier
%%T matrix is the ouput class label in this example it is the delay in the binary form.
X=[num(:,20),num(:,1),num(:,7),num(:,8),num(:,9),num(:,10),num(:,11),num(:,12),num(:,13),num(:,14),num(:,15),num(:,16),num(:,18),num(:,19),num(:,17)];
%T=num(:,17);

%%dividing the given data into training and testing data
%%randomly select the training set and testing set 
%%data_rand=randomly distributing the rows from the X matrix
%%tr=amount of data that should be divided as training data
%%te=amount of data that should be divided as testing data
%%trainingData and testingData is the data after dividing the X matrix into 75% training data nad 25% testing data
data_rand = X(randperm(size(X,1)),:);
tr=ceil(.75*length(data_rand));
te=length(data_rand)-tr;
trainingData= data_rand(1:tr,:);
testingData= data_rand(1:te,:);

%%forming X and T matrix
%%Ttr=T matrix of the training data
%%Tte=T matrix of the testing data
%%X=X matrix correcponding to the training data
%%T=T matrix corresponding to the training data
Ttr=trainingData(:,15);
Tte=testingData(:,15);

%%convert T into -1 and 1 instead of 0 and 1
for i=1:length(X)

%%temp is the T matrix that we get after all the binary classifier steps.

%%delay of flight from the data.
